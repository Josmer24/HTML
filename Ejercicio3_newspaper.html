  <h1>The Other War</h1>
  <p>By William Safire <br> Feb. 24, 2003 </p>
  <p>In calculations by terror governments, only the certainty of
    <br>relentless military pressure and ultimate defeat truly focuses the
    <br>mind.
    <br>
    <br>In Baghdad, that necessary assurance of doom is still lacking.
    <br>Thanks to the populist pacifism of Germany's chancellor, the
    <br>crowd-pleasing anti-Americanism of France's president and the
    <br>blossoming of the perennial peace ''movement,'' Saddam Hussein
    <br>is convinced that he can persevere.
    <br>
    <br>With some logic, the dictator of Iraq has taken heart from the 
    <br>marching rallies and the TV railing. He believes that the tried-and-true 
    <br>technique that has maintained him in power will work again: deceive and 
    <br>resist, shift the burden of proof, concede enough to prevent attack, divide 
    <br>and delay. For as long as U.N. bickering gives him a chance to avoid disarming, 
    <br>he will take his chances on a war.
